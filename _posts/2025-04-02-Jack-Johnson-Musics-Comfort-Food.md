# Jack Johnson, Music's Comfort Food

Im sure we all have those artists or songs, that feel like a warm hug when you're down. The musical equivalent of hot bowl of soup on a cold night or a dinner roast with the family. For me, and I suspect for many others, Jack Johnson occupies that space. His music, with its gentle acoustic melodies and understated charm, is the ultimate comfort food for the ears.

My journey with Jack Johnson began, rather strangely, with a LimeWire mistake. Sometime around 2008, I went searching for Tokio Hotel's angsty release, "Monsoon". Instead, thanks to a poorly labeled file, I ended up with "Monsoon" by Jack Johnson.

To my surprise, I loved it. The laid-back vibe was a stark contrast to the dramatic rock I was expecting, but it resonated deeply. I even ended up utilising the song for some Engligh assessments for my final years at school.

However, after school, Jack Johnson faded into the background for a while. It wasn't until years later, when I rediscovered his music, that I truly appreciated its enduring appeal. And it wasn't just me. My partner and I even chose "Better Together" as a song to play at our wedding, a testament to the simple, heartfelt emotions his music evokes.

Writing about a musician was not something I expected to do with this blog. But while organising my CD collection recently, I discovered that Jack Johnson was my most common artist. Ive been slowly accumulating CDs and I've found small treasures like *Sleep Through the Static*, *Sing-A-Longs and Lullabies for the Film Curious George*, *In Between Dreams*. *On and On*, and *Brushfire Fairytales* for pocket change on eBay and at local Op shops. While they might not be highly sought-after collector's items, these CDs hold a special place in my music collection. They stand in stark contrast to the often loud rock and electronic albums that dominate my collection, offering a moment of serene relaxation. They are the perfect addition to a quiet Sunday evening, a moment to lay back on the sofa and just chill.

I think Jack's acoustic, almost minimalist, sound is what draws me to his work. Simple guitar, gentle percussion and a soft, almost friendly, voice makes his music a welcome respite. Anyone feeling a little overwhelmed might find some refuge in his music.
