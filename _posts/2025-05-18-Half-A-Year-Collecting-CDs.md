# Half a Year Collecting CDs – A Local Library Revival

It’s been over 6 months since I started collecting CDs again, and what started as a curiosity has turned into a proper collection. I’ve now got over 80 albums ripped to FLAC, totaling around 3800 tracks and nearly 60GB in size. Majority of it leans into alternative and punk rock, but the library is ever changing. 

The last time I had a local music library like this was probably around 2012, back before I made the jump to Google Play Music (now YouTube Music). Back then my music was acquired from the high seas. Streaming offered a cheap and __*Legal*__ alternative to finding my own music. Streaming still has its perks – instant access to almost anything and the ability to discover new artists quickly – but I’ve realized it also comes at a cost. Over time, I became detached from the music. I’d let the algorithm decide what to play next, often without even noticing the artist or song title. It felt passive. Disposable.

Now, with everything local again, there’s a level of connection that just wasn’t there before. I choose what to listen to. I browse albums. I see the cover art. When I listen to an album, I recall where I bought it from and the excitement I felt when I stumbled on a new (to me) album in the local Op shop. I listen to albums in full rather then just the one or two tracks that made the artist famous. There is a sense of *ownership* and *control* in the experience - which cant be said for streaming.

My ripping workflow is pretty straightforward: I rip CDs using **Sound Juicer** into lossless FLAC, clean up tagging with **MusicBrainz Picard**, and then everything gets loaded into **Jellyfin**, which I stream on mobile using **Finamp**. It’s fast, clean, and works exactly how I want it to. No ads. No recommendations. Just my library. 

The biggest issue Ive had when ripping music is when a track fails to copy. **Sound Juicer** will sit there for hours unable to rip a track. Sometimes I can get away with simply copy/pasting the track manually but thats not a silver bullet. Ive found it has little to do with the age of the disc (although disc rot is of course a thing) but more with the condition of the disc - aka _**scratches**_. Ive had to abandon a few tracks simply because the disc will not rip.

It’s been fun hunting down albums too. Some second-hand stores have absolute gems hiding in them. I'll often stop by the local Op shops just to see if they have more CD's to check out. Its a bit of a lottery and it scratches that dopamine addiction we all have without spending hours staring at a screen. A couple times Ive left with a stack of CD's - many times I leave with nothing. But thats part of the fun.

What I cant find on CD, I turn to Bandcamp. CD sales fell off a cliff in the 2010's. So finding more recent music second hand is near impossible. Some artists, especially the smaller indie ones, may never release their music on CD. Ive purchased 21 items from Bandcamp at the time of writing. Artists including (but not limited to) _OVERWERK_, _Posy_, _MASTER BOOT RECORD_, _Yours Truly_ and _Rise Against_. These purchases help fill out the library of something more recent. Im not opposed to purchasing new physical CD's either, Ive just found it cheaper and easier to purchase digitally.

I’ve been especially loving the *Triple J Hottest 100* compilation albums – they’ve made up a large part of my listening experience.

Honestly, going back to local music has been a small but meaningful change. It’s more intentional. More tactile. And it brings back some of the joy that got lost somewhere along the way in the streaming era.

If you’ve ever felt like you're *listening*, but not really *hearing*, maybe it’s time to take your music back, too.
