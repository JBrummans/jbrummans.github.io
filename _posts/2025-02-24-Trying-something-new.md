For my first post, I wanted to note down my reasons for starting a blog.

Ive never been one to share my thoughts online. Always lurking but never posting. The trigger for change was brought on by a recent video from *Technology Connections* titled [*"Algorithms are breaking how we think"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA). It sparked a chain of thought about the current state of the internet and sent me down a rabbit hole leading to the concept of the "Small Web".
