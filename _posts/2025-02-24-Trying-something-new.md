For my first post, I wanted to note down my reasons for starting a blog (and how I'll be doing it).

Ive never been one to share my thoughts online. Always lurking but never posting. The trigger for change was brought on by a recent video from **Technology Connections** titled [*"Algorithms are breaking how we think"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA). It sparked a chain of thought about the current state of the internet and sent me down a rabbit hole leading to the concept of the "Small Web".

I think many people may have found the same path before me. Finding [this post](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web) from **Kagi** and a blog post [*"The small web is beautiful"*](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/) by Ben Hoyt cemented the idea to give this a go.

Ive been on a bit of a journey through time at the moment and this fits right in with that. Recently I started collecting music CD's, pulled out my PS3 recently (Almost exclusively to play [Infamous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infamous_(video_game))) and downgraded from a S23 a Samsung S9 to see how a phone from 2018 fairs in 2025 (Surprisingly well).

As for how I'll do the blog, for now I'll stick with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for the site hosting and after a quick search [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) will handle the site generation. I enjoy writing my notes in markdown so this seems to tick all my boxes.
