# Mini Essay or Blogging

I recently watched a video on YouTube titled [Mini Essays - The Perfect Tool for Lifelong Learners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi8meiPUt84) by creator *Odysseas*. It got me thinking about the difference between a Mini Essay and a blog.

My initial thought was that they are largely similar. However on further thought and reading I can understand the differences. Mini essays are short (typically a few hundred words) and focused on a single topic. The intention is just as much for the *author* to learn as the *audience* is as well.

A blog post is far less rigid in its structure and intentions. A single blog post could be any length of words, about any number of topics and for equal parts entertainment as education.

The lines between the two can be blurry. But I think thats ok. Like writing a diary, the act of putting words to a page (or screen) to process thoughts and ideas is what matters. Whether thats a structured and succinct mini essay or a stream of thoughts and ideas in a blog.
