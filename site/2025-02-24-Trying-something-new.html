    <p>For my first post, I wanted to note down my reasons for starting a blog (and how I'll be doing it).</p>
<p>Ive never been one to share my thoughts online. Always lurking but never posting. The trigger for change was brought on by a recent video from <strong>Technology Connections</strong> titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA"><em>"Algorithms are breaking how we think"</em></a>. It sparked a chain of thought about the current state of the internet and sent me down a rabbit hole leading to the concept of the "Small Web".</p>
<p>I think many people may have found the same path before me. Finding <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/small-web">this post</a> from <strong>Kagi</strong> and a blog post <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/"><em>"The small web is beautiful"</em></a> by Ben Hoyt cemented the idea to give this a go.</p>
<p>Ive been on a bit of a journey through time at the moment and this fits right in with that. Recently I started collecting music CD's, pulled out my PS3 recently (Almost exclusively to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infamous_(video_game)">Infamous</a>) and downgraded from a S23 a Samsung S9 to see how a phone from 2018 fairs in 2025 (Surprisingly well).</p>
<p>As for how I'll do the blog, for now I'll stick with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> for the site hosting and after a quick search <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> will handle the site generation. I enjoy writing my notes in markdown so this seems to tick all my boxes.</p>
