    <h1>Mini Essay or Blogging</h1>
<p>I recently watched a video on YouTube titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi8meiPUt84">Mini Essays - The Perfect Tool for Lifelong Learners</a> by creator <em>Odysseas</em>. It got me thinking about the difference between a Mini Essay and a blog.</p>
<p>My initial thought was that they are largely similar. However on further thought and reading I can understand the differences. Mini essays are short (typically a few hundred words) and focused on a single topic. The intention is more for the <em>author</em> to learn rather then the <em>audience</em>. (although there is no requirement to make the essay's public)</p>
<p>A blog post is far less rigid in its structure and intentions. A single blog post could be any length of words, about any number of topics and for equal parts entertainment as education.</p>
<p>The lines between the two can be blurry. But I think thats ok. Like writing a diary, the act of putting words to a page (or screen) to process thoughts and ideas is what matters. Whether thats a structured and succinct mini essay or a stream of thoughts and ideas in a blog.</p>
