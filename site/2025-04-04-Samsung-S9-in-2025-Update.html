    <p>After over a month of using the S9, I think its time to end my little experiment.
While the phone has held up surprisingly well considering its age, the battery has continued to show signs its dying. Now sitting at 76% (down from 84% when I wrote my last <a href="{% post_url 2025-02-27-Samsung-S9-in-2025 %}">blog post</a> meaning im reaching for the charger very frequently.</p>
<p>Performance has also been an issue. Switching apps feels even worse then before. Its never stopped working but the slowness gets more painful when in a hurry.
I'll be returning to my Samsung S23 for now. Ill miss the smaller size, rear finger print sensor and 3.5mm headphone jack the most.</p>
<p>Oh well, onto the next thing.</p>
