May of this year I got my motorbike licence. At the time, my father-in-law said he would find a motorbike for me. Six months down the track, he calls one Saturday to tell me he has the bike and that we’re going to pick it up. Yay!

A couple of hours later I’ve got a 2007 [Sachs 150 Express](../images/Sachs150) and no idea how to ride it. (When I say *no idea*, the last time I rode a motorbike was at least five years ago on a farm, so riding on the road was very new to me.)

The bike itself was in good condition for its age. It starts well enough and all parts are original. Researching this bike was a pain. There is very limited information available. I managed to find a [user manual](../files/sachs-express-150-user-manual.pdf), plus a couple of forum posts and reviews, but aside from that it’s basically a no-name Chinese-made bike. It didn’t help that the registration papers listed the model as a _FYM FY150-3_, and my insurance provider said it was a _Sachs 150KN_, just to add to the confusion.

A quick Google found some reviews claiming the bike is a copy of a [Suzuki GS125](https://www.productreview.com.au/listings/sachs-express) or a [Suzuki GN125](https://netrider.net.au/threads/review-2008-sachs-express-150kn.93878/), which is good to know for future repairs.

There were a couple of known issues with it that the previous owner told me about:

- Dead battery  
- [Rear left blinker broken but working](../images/Sachs150RearLeftBlinker.jpg), held on with screws and tape  
- [Left mirror desilvered](../images/Sachs150LeftMirror.jpg)  
- _Very_ minor surface rust  

The rust was the first thing I tackled. While giving the bike a good clean, I sprayed the rust spots with WD-40 and scrubbed them with a rough pad. The bike was apparently stored in a shed for most of its life, so any rust was very minor. I also took the opportunity to top up the brake fluid.

Next on the list was that left blinker. It felt like it was about to fall off whenever I touched it. Removing the tape revealed it was really being held together by bits of [unknown plastic and small screws](../images/Sachs150RearLeftBlinkerNoTape.jpg). I decided to take the quick route and superglue some plastic pieces back on to cover the missing chunks from the blinker, then secured it with bolts using the original internal brackets. Not amazing, but [far better than before](../images/Sachs150RearLeftBlinkerFixed.jpg).

Moving on to the mirror. After a quick bit of eBay hunting, I actually found an exact replacement for my mirror. However, it was $60 and shipped from America, so instead I opted for these [cheapo replacements](../images/Sachs150EbayMirror.png), which were far cheaper as a set and delivered much faster. They actually turned out [really good](../images/Sachs150NewMirror.jpg) (for the price I paid) and are surprisingly similar to the originals.

TBC — still need to get a new battery.
