I've been reminiscing lately about handheld gaming. I do have a Switch 2 (and prior to that a Switch 1), which I have gotten so much value out of, but they're not a handheld in the same way a PSP or DS was. They’re home consoles you can take outside but honestly who does that? The focus is fundamentally different, and true dedicated portables are dead.

As someone who grew up with a Gameboy, GBA, DS, and even a 3DS for a while before finally moving to the Switch, I lived through the change. But for me, the peak of that era, the true media powerhouse, was the PSP.

I still remember picking up my PSP 1000 around 2009 from a mate for a steal. $70 bucks, and it came with *God of War: Chains of Olympus*. That machine wasn't just for games; it was a mobile media center in my pocket. I have incredibly fond memories of dumping the early seasons of *Red vs Blue* on it. Also music visualizers are awesome and need to return.

The PSP enshrined the era of the AA handheld game.

The Vita was an amazing piece of gear but support just wasn't there. And the 3DS struggled early on in its life too. We lost something huge when these finally died. We used to get proper, fully-fledged entries from major IPs, built specifically for the handheld it was targeting. Such as *God of War* and *Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City/Vice City Stories* on the PSP. Or the *Metroid Prime Hunters* doing its best to bring an FPS to the DS. Even later, the Vita got *Uncharted: Golden Abyss*. None of these were necessarily the best in their respective series, but they offered more of what we loved and iterated on established formulas created by their bigger beefier home consoles and main line entries. That middle ground, AA budget, major IP on a system you can fit in your pocket, is essentially gone.

A game I've come back to several times is the PSP version of *Star Wars: Force Unleashed* which is such a fun experience. The PSP version was similar to the PS2 and Wii versions but was more fun to play than its big brother on the PS3/360. We no longer get a chance to have more than one version of a game.

Speaking of multiple versions of a game, movie tie-ins! While not always the best works of art, we also lost many Movie tie in games around this time too. Many were pretty terrible but there was some fun to be had. Games like the DS version of *Eragon*, which I would argue was better than the PC version that I also played, had some unique gameplay thanks to the DS touch screen.

That kind of rapid, IP-driven content (whether good or bad) simply vanished, replaced by either massive multi-platform titles or nothing at all.

We can technically still play games on the go, but it’s not the same focus. The Steam Deck and Switch 2 are technically portable systems. But I miss the era where a handheld was a different beast entirely, where smaller teams made incredible focused AA experiences that complemented the big console releases. It was a special time. Just a shame it's gone. :(
