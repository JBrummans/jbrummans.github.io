Released in 2007, *Heavenly Sword* was the game that sold me on the PS3. I got to play the first few levels at a friend’s place, and it didn’t take long to convince me to buy the console. I’m sure anyone who played the game remembers the iconic level with Nariko — our leading lady — running across ropes strung through ancient ruins. That moment really showcased the kind of cinematic action experience Ninja Theory was aiming for: intense combat and stunning visuals.

However, after replaying the game recently, my feelings toward it have soured considerably. The rose-tinted glasses had to come off.

The game starts off strong, with epic battle scenes featuring hordes of enemies on screen — perfect for showing off the game’s visuals. The facial animations were phenomenal for the time, especially King Bohan (the main antagonist), who is portrayed incredibly well. He manages to be both *likable* and *detestable*, which is a testament to the actor’s performance. The story sets up well in the beginning, but weakens significantly as the game progresses.

Speaking of weaknesses, the gameplay is probably the biggest letdown. On this playthrough, the cracks in the design became much more apparent.

Comparing *Heavenly Sword* to *God of War* (GoW) really highlights how far ahead even the first two GoW games were in terms of gameplay. For some reason, Ninja Theory introduced a stance system that added unnecessary button mashing to the mix. You’ve got your standard **Square** and **Triangle** attacks, similar to *GoW*, but holding **L1** or **R1** switches you into either ranged or heavy attack modes.

- The *ranged stance* functions like a weaker light attack and is mostly only useful for deflecting certain projectiles.  
- The *heavy stance* is arguably more effective than the default one.  
- There’s also a *parry system* activated by pressing **Triangle** just before an enemy strikes.

Enemies glow blue or orange to indicate which stance can counter their attack, and red if the attack is unparryable. This creates a lot of frantic stance-switching and button mashing, especially for players who aren’t quick to adapt (*me, I guess*).

While the game is relatively easy overall, the difficulty spikes in the last hour or two. I found myself increasingly frustrated, missing parries and taking a few too many hits.

There’s also a knockdown mechanic: if an enemy falls to the ground, you can finish them off with a single blow. Unfortunately, Nariko often auto-targets nearby enemies instead, forcing you to pause, reposition, and hope your button press connects with the downed enemy.

The game occasionally uses a split-screen camera technique that shows two views from different angles. This is used effectively — though sparingly — throughout the story, particularly in cutscenes and during some of Kai’s shooting sections.

Speaking of Kai, Nariko's stand-in younger sister: her sections do help break up the button-mashing monotony. However, the later segments drag on too long considering how simple her gameplay mechanics are. Additionally, her controls are clunky — aiming snaps the camera into an over-the-shoulder view in whatever direction Kai was facing, resulting in some janky, frustrating gameplay that just doesn't feel smooth.

Lastly, the music is decent, but the **Circle** button triggers a special move that charges over time. Using this move instantly kills an enemy, but it plays a short musical snippet that abruptly cuts off the background music — completely killing the vibe.

In hindsight, *Heavenly Sword* feels like a product of its time — visually ambitious and cinematic, but held back by clunky gameplay and uneven pacing. While it still deserves credit for its presentation and performance capture (especially for its era), the actual moment-to-moment gameplay hasn't aged well.

It’s a game that made a strong first impression, but unfortunately doesn’t hold up under a modern lens. In this instance, I don’t even think an HD remaster would be enough to fix its flaws. Replaying it was a reminder of how far action games have come — and sometimes, **it’s better to let fond memories remain just that.**
